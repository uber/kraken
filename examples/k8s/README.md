# Running Kraken in Kubernetes

This folder contains example k8s configuration files to set up kraken in your k8s cluster. This
is the most minimal setup to guide users and give a quick overview of what minimal sets of
configs are needed.

Kraken will come up with 1 origin, 1 tracker, 1 proxy and 1 build-index, but those should all
be > 1 in production. Each node will get a kraken agent and have `localhost:30081` as a pullable
registry location.

Kraken's backend will be a simple http fileserver: `testfs`. In production you would have S3 or
HDFS instead of that.

The deployment `demo.json` is an example of an application that got its image pulled from Kraken.

## Running the simple example

Simply run `make kubecluster` from the base of the repo.

## Expected output

`kubectl get pods` should output a healthy set of pods:
```
